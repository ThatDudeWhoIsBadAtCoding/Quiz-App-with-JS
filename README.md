I thought I should update it by adding a login module with node.js

Dummy Account if you don't want to add your own personal email

username: "Test Account"

pass: "pass123"
`run db.js in terminal using node to boot up and then open localhost 3000`
**Be sure to change the email and pass in db.js line 81 and 82 (also 88) with your email and pass, otherwise it won't be able to send the mail**
**Uses nodemailer for sending mail**

use `npm install nodemailer express nedb`

Express is used for setting up the server and backend
nodemailer is used for sending mails
and nedb is a simple and lightweight database
