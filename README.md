I thought I should update it by adding a login module with node.js and some extra features like a timer

**Improved the quiz app overall, the questions are now different each time and it also renders all the ", @, ! and other symbols which it did not previously**

`run db.js in terminal using node to boot up and then open localhost 3000`
**Be sure to change the email and pass in db.js line 81 and 82 (also 88) with your email and pass, otherwise it won't be able to send the mail**
**Uses nodemailer for sending mail**

use `npm install nodemailer express nedb`

Express is used for setting up the server and backend
nodemailer is used for sending mails
and nedb is a simple and lightweight database
